#dParse
dParse is a strong jQuery-like HTML parser written in PHP. I initiated this project when I realized that the current parsers ([Simple HTML DOM](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net), [Ganon](https://code.google.com/p/ganon/), etc) that we can find on the Internet could be improved. So I decided to create a PHP parser that is better by improving the following points:  
  - Speed
  - Features
  - Flexibility
  - Memory use

## Notice
This is just an initial alpha commit, the parser is almost finished, I just need to add support for CSS pseudo-selectors queries, write a few more DOM manipulation functions and make quick examples with well-known websites such as Wikipedia or Youtube.

I will write a full documentation once done.
